### Checkmate Changes in Update 7.3.0.5

{id="checkmate-changes-in-update-7.3.0.5"}

> _"Based on player feedback, we’re making some changes to Checkmate in tomorrow’s update. Due to the amount of tuning,
> Checkmate will be moved back to Labs._
>
> _Next week will feature 3v3 Clash which has been modified to reflect a fan favorite mode from the original Destiny,
> Skirmish._
>
> _We'll also be adjusting all Primary weapons to join Hand Cannons in having the same optimal Time-to-Kill (TTK) as
> they do in the base sandbox. In modes like Clash and Control, you will now start the game with two kills worth of
> special ammo (ex. 2 shots for shotguns)._
>
> _We’re increasing the amount of special ammo credit you get for assists and deaths, so you will get special ammo
> pulls more frequently, but are reducing the amount of special ammo you get from approximately three kills worth to
> two kills, to reduce snowballing._
>
> _We want the reduced uptime of abilities in the PvP sandbox, but the current level of ability cooldown tuning made
> some abilities feel impractical to use. Ability cooldown penalties are being reduced from 30% to 15% and melee
> damage is being increased to allow two melees to kill._
>
> _We will run one more Checkmate Trials Lab later this season (on February 9) with the new tuning, but Checkmate is
> not currently planned to be in the Control node again._
>
> _We will have the full details on everything that is changing with weapon archetype tuning and other game mode rules
> in the patch notes tomorrow._
>
> _We'll continue to review feedback as you play so please try out this new iteration and tell us how it feels."_

- > _"For anyone worried that these changes to Checkmate will permanently change a fun mode you enjoy, we wanted to
  > clarify our intentions for the current round of Checkmate tuning:_
  >
  > _While it is not our intention to make the original Checkmate into the core PvP experience, we are experimenting
  with
  > the current iteration of Checkmate to gather data, lessons, and feedback we can use to eventually tune the base PvP
  > sandbox._
  >
  > _Things like primary weapon balance, special ammo economy, and ability uptime are easier to alter in a single
  > modifier, which gives us freedom to iterate quickly. The goal of all these changes is to make a more skilled, more
  > deliberate sandbox that retains the Destiny magic._
  >
  > _Later in the season, once we have tuned the base PvP sandbox, we will continue developing Checkmate as a standalone
  > modifier. We plan to lean further into its identity as a more tactical, gunplay focused mode going back to no
  > starting special and higher reduction of abilities._
  >
  > _More changes are coming to the Crucible. If you want to help shape the future of PvP, the best way to start is by
  > participating in Crucible Labs and giving feedback below on what you enjoy, and what you don’t."_
